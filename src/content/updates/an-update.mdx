## Hi again!

It’s been a little while since my last post (145 days, to be exact), and I wanted to take a moment to check in and let you know that I’m back and ready to share some projects.

The past few months have been a mix of a busy work schedule and a personal break, which is why I stepped away from developing this website for a bit. Sometimes the fast pace of —and that’s exactly what I did. I’m grateful for the time I took, and I feel refreshed and energized to reconnect here.

Since my last update, I’ve completed part of an exciting project: installing a bell system at my firehouse’s satellite location.

On a personal note, I also started a new job at the beginning of this month. It’s an new chapter for me, and I’m looking forward to seeing how it influences the content I’ll share going forward.

I plan to keep this space alive by writing roughly once a month about whatever comes to mind—whether it’s projects I’m working on,  tech experiments I’m diving into or anything else I fancy writing about. For example, I’m currently starting to build my own home lab/server from a mix of new and older computer parts, which I’m eager to share with you soon.

Thanks for stopping by and being part of this journey. Feel free to ask any questions, share your thoughts, or suggest topics you’d like me to explore. I’m excited to reconnect and keep this conversation going.

See you soon.
