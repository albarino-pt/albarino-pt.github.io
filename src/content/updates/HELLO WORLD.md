### Hi friend!

Welcome to  my internet conner.<br>
I decided to create this website to solve 2 "situations".

1. I wanted to join two websites I've Build in the past. (one was a pseudo database of my projects and the other a simple website with my social media links)

2. I was having some issues with the SSL certificates of those two websites. So instead of solving that problem I decided to start fresh and make another website. (that way.. If I ever get another issue with the certificates I would only have to solve that for one website and not two)
