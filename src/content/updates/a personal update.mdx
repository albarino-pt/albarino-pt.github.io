## Hi friend!

### The newspaper apearance
For starters I should tell you that I am also a volunteer firefighter, on January 6th did something that ended up on the local newspaper. (see the full article in portuguese inthe image below)

## The first accomplishment
For years I wanted to have my own server. I wanted to cosplay as a sysadmin, build my own server, install and test some OS's and learn something in the realms of everything server related.
