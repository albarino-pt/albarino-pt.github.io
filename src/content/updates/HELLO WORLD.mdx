## Hi friend!

Welcome to  my internet conner.\
I decided to create this website to solve 2 "situations".
1. I wanted to join two websites I've Build in the past. (one was a pseudo database of my projects and the other a simple website with my
social media links)
2. I was having some issues with the SSL certificates of those two websites. So instead of solving that problem I decided to start fresh and make
another website. (that way.. If I ever get another issue with the certificates I would only have to solve that for one website and not two)
***
## The Adventure
Shout out to  <a href="https://Kai.bi" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Kai</a> (I used his template)\
I wanted to make two blog like pages one for my [/projects](/projects) and another for my [/updates](/updates).\
And so I did.

The first problem that I encountered was that I needed two "blog-like" pages that had to update automatically a section on 
[/landing](/index). I am now able to update the [/projects](/projects) and [/updates](/updates) by simply addind or modifying
a <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Markdown</a> file on the projects folders. 

To be continued
